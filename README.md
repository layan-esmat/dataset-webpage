# Web Form with Status Toggle

This project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I built a one-line input form that takes a user's name and age, and stores the data in a MySQL database. I used PHP to connect to the database and insert the submitted data.

Below the form, I displayed all the records from the database in a table. Each record includes a toggle button that switches the status value between 0 and 1. I used JavaScript and AJAX to send a request to a separate PHP file when the button is clicked, so the status updates immediately without refreshing the page.

The project is organized into multiple files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP), all placed in a single folder.

I tested the project locally using XAMPP and accessed it at:
http://localhost/webform-toggle/index.php
